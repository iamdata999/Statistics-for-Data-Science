# Instructional Units Overview

##### 1.Descriptive Statistics: Learners begin by mastering techniques to summarize and describe datasets. Key measures covered include:
-Mean: The average value of a dataset.

-Median: The middle value separating the higher half from the lower half of the dataset.

-Standard Deviation: A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values.

##### 2.Basic Probability: This unit introduces the fundamental concepts of probability theory. Learners will:
-Analyze uncertain events.

-Calculate probabilities, understanding the likelihood of different outcomes.

##### 3.Random Variables: Here, learners delve into the principles of probability distributions, which are crucial for data analysis. Key concepts include:
-Discrete and Continuous Random Variables: Understanding different types of data.

-Probability Distributions: Learning about common distributions like the normal, binomial, and Poisson distributions.

##### 4.Sampling and Confidence Intervals: Learners will explore the importance of sampling techniques and how to estimate population parameters. They will learn to:
-Implement various sampling methods.

-Construct and interpret confidence intervals to gauge the precision of sample estimates.

##### 5.Hypothesis Testing: The final unit covers the formulation and testing of hypotheses using statistical tests. Learners will:

-Develop hypotheses based on data questions.

-Use tests such as t-tests and chi-square tests to make informed decisions based on data analysis.

##### Learning Outcomes

By mastering these concepts and techniques, learners will be equipped with the necessary statistical skills to:

-Effectively analyze and interpret data.

-Make data-driven decisions.

-Draw meaningful insights from data in various data science applications.

These skills are crucial for any data scientist, as they form the foundation for more advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques. Through this module, learners will gain confidence in their ability to handle real-world datasets and derive actionable insights.
